// Learning Objective
// Learn how to respond to events triggred by user interactions and handle user input via forms in React

// Q: What is everything in Web Dev concentared around?
// - In web dev everything is focused around the DOM.
// - Based on a built in loop that listens for changes across some part of the UI is what the DOM is.
// - To access the event loop the in the Virtual DOM the react team put togther what is calle dthe "Synthetic Event" so that we can pretty much have access to all the event's we would need to prvide users with an interactive web application.
// - If I can understand how to harness the power of events I will be on my way to building a React Web Application

// Q: What is significant about the fact that events are in any programming language are unique to the language itself?
// - Beause each progamming languge may run diffrent based on its type. Javascript for example run on the brower and it has very eloquent ways of handleing eventys that are triggred by user interaction.
// - As a web developer I must be most concrended with the way JS  handles events triggred by user intercactions.
// - We must ask ourselves, how do we take in user input via forms and respind to clicks, mouse vents, and scrolling?
// - In the following material I will learn how to respond to events within the React Ecosystem.

// Q: What is different to handeling events with React elements and plain old DOM elements?
// - React events are named using camelCasing , rather than lowercase
// - With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

// Q: Why is it important to understand that React has its own "Sythetic Event" built into its API?
// - beause it mimics event handling as I am already used to when using when it comes to the DOM.
// - When I bind up click/change/mouseOver handlers to the elements, we usually do so on the elemsnt itslef, or we sleect the DOM element using vanilla JS to target by ID and append some function handler to te element.

// Q: What is the purpose of todays exersice?
// - To get familiar with the React sytnax to handle events using Components/JSX and vanilla JS functions handlers.
// - Beging able to handle events with React is where things get a little more interesting.
// - Becuase React provides what we call the 'Sythetic Event' which is simlar to the Event object in the DOM. This is how we inteact with the DOM within the React Virtual DOM ecoysystem.
