// Overview
// Q:What will I cover today?
// - I will learn how to use classes to build react components
// Q: Why are react class components important to the react ecosystem?
// - Class components brought a lot of functionality that wasn't there before with the original React API when using function components.
// - However it is now available with hook components. But this is a new feature to the react ecosystem.
// - So learning class componenents is impornatant because the majory of React code is written with class components.

// Learning Objectives
// - I should be able to explain what class components are. While being able to use class components to render state data to DOM.
// - I should be able to share data between class components using state and props.
// - I should also be able to respond to events triggred by user interactions, while being able to handle user inputs via forms in React.
